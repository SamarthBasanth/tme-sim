# Deployment — running Studio for a team, not just yourself

Studio (`app/server` + `app/web`) was built as a local diagnostic workstation
tool: `python -m app.server` binds to `127.0.0.1` by default and, until this
document, had no authentication at all. This page covers what changes when a
pharma/biotech or research team wants to reach it from somewhere other than
the machine it's running on.

**What this does NOT cover.** Any use involving real, identifiable patient
data or a clinical decision. Every dataset this project ships with is open,
public research data (10x Genomics/GEO Xenium and Visium sections) with no
patient-identifiable information — see `docs/DATA_INVENTORY.md`. If your team
plans to reconstruct anything else, that's a different risk posture than what
is set up here, and needs its own review before you follow this guide.

---

## 1. The three ways to run this

### 1a. Local, single-user (the default, unchanged)

```bash
vivum studio
```

Binds to `127.0.0.1`. No API key is required or generated. Nothing here
changes this path — every test and every piece of documentation that predates
this page still applies exactly as written.

### 1b. On your own network, one shared key

```bash
vivum studio --host 0.0.0.0 --api-key <a-real-secret>
```

or generate one automatically:

```bash
vivum studio --host 0.0.0.0
```

```
  api key     Xk3n... [generated (not persisted -- save it now)]
              every request needs header: X-API-Key: Xk3n...
```

Passing any `--host` other than `127.0.0.1`/`localhost`/`::1` with no
`--api-key` and no `TMESIM_STUDIO_API_KEY` environment variable **auto-
generates a random key and prints it once** rather than serving
unauthenticated — this project's own principle ("a failure a user caused
comes back as a diagnostic, never a silent default") applied to the
deployment surface, not just the protocol language. The generated key is
**not written to disk anywhere** — copy it from the terminal output before
you lose the process.

Open `http://<host>:<port>/` in a browser. The frontend shows an **"Access
key required"** gate on first load if the server needs one; paste the key in
once and it's remembered in that browser's `localStorage` for next time. A
wrong key shows an inline error and lets you retry, rather than failing
silently or falling back to fake demo data (the earlier version of this app
would degrade to synthetic stub data on ANY unreachable/rejected request,
which would have silently shown plausible-looking fake numbers instead of a
real reconstruction — fixed as part of adding this gate).

If you'd rather set the key yourself (e.g. to something a whole team already
shares) instead of taking the generated one:

```bash
TMESIM_STUDIO_API_KEY=<your-key> vivum studio --host 0.0.0.0
```

An already-exported `TMESIM_STUDIO_API_KEY` is always respected over the
auto-generate-or-refuse logic above, so this composes correctly with Docker's
`-e` / systemd's `Environment=` / your shell profile.

**What this is, and isn't.** One shared secret, checked on every `/api/*`
request. It stops a stranger on the network from using the tool; it does
**not** give you separate accounts, audit logs, or per-user permissions. If
your team needs that, this is the wrong layer to build it in — put a real
auth proxy in front (see §3) rather than extending this shared-key check.

### 1c. Docker

```bash
docker build -t vivum-studio .
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -v $(pwd)/data_cache:/app/data_cache \
  -e TMESIM_STUDIO_API_KEY=<your-key> \
  vivum-studio --host 0.0.0.0
```

**Honesty note on this section specifically:** the `Dockerfile` was written
and its *pip install step* verified locally (an editable install from
`pyproject.toml` alone needs pip >= 21.3 / PEP 660 support — confirmed this
fails with an old pip and works once upgraded, which is why the Dockerfile
upgrades pip before installing). Docker itself is not installed in the
environment this was written in, so **the full containerized build has not
been run end-to-end**. Build it once yourself and open an issue/fix a layer
if something in the base-image step doesn't match what's described here.

`data_cache/` is gitignored and not baked into the image (this project's
"real data, explicitly acquired, never silently bundled" rule extends to the
container) — mount your own populated cache, or run `vivum acquire` /
follow `docs/REPRODUCE.md` §2b inside the running container to fetch it.

---

## 1d. Restart to pick up sections ingested by another process

`app/server/ingest_registry.py` reads the ingested-section table (real
GBM-Space / breast / etc. sections, on top of the 7 built-in ones) **once per
process** and caches it in memory. If a long-running Studio server is already
up and a separate process registers a new section — a data-ingestion script,
or `POST /api/sections/scan` hit against a short-lived second instance — the
running server keeps serving its stale, older list until restarted. There is
no live-reload. If `/api/sections` looks thinner than you expect (only the 7
built-ins, none of the sections you know you've ingested), restart the
server before assuming the data is missing.

To register a section that already has real data in `data_cache/` but isn't
in the dropdown yet (this repo's breast-cancer Xenium section, for example,
was ingested via direct Python calls in earlier work rather than through this
route, so it needed registering separately):

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/sections/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"path": "data_cache/<your-section-dir>", "register": true, "section_id": "<id>", "label": "<label>"}'
```

This persists to `app/runs/_ingested_sections.json` (gitignored, local state)
and is picked up immediately by the process that ran the scan — other
already-running processes still need the restart above.

## 2. What is NOT handled for you

* **TLS.** This serves plain HTTP. Put a reverse proxy in front for anything
  crossing an untrusted network (Caddy and nginx both terminate TLS for a
  single backend in ~10 lines of config; this project deliberately doesn't
  bundle one, to avoid maintaining certificate/domain logic orthogonal to the
  simulator itself).
* **Multi-user accounts.** One shared key, not per-user identity. See §1b.
* **Rate limiting / abuse protection.** None. A reverse proxy is also the
  right place for this if you need it.
* **Horizontal scaling.** `app/server/cache.py`'s reconstruction cache and
  `app/server/jobs.py`'s job queue are both single-process, in-memory
  structures — running two replicas behind a load balancer would give each
  one its own cache and queue, silently duplicating reconstruction work and
  splitting run history. Run one instance.

---

## 3. A reasonable reference setup

For a small pharma/research team (a handful of people, trusted network or VPN,
no need for per-user accounts):

```
[team's machines] --HTTPS--> [Caddy/nginx, TLS termination] --HTTP, localhost--> [vivum studio --host 127.0.0.1]
```

i.e. keep Studio itself bound to loopback (no API key needed at all — the
proxy is the boundary), and let the reverse proxy own TLS + whatever
authentication your organization already has for internal tools (basic auth,
an SSO gateway, a VPN requirement). This is usually less work than exposing
Studio directly with `--host 0.0.0.0` and its own key, and centralizes auth
in infrastructure you're probably already running rather than in this
application.

Use §1b's own API key instead when there's no existing reverse proxy /
internal-tools auth to sit behind, and a shared secret is an acceptable bar
for who can reach it.
